# Obsidian Shipping Templates

## What this is
A small, opinionated template pack for Obsidian that keeps projects focused on shipping. It is plain Markdown, requires no plugins, and works in a fresh vault.

## Who it’s for
Solo builders and small teams who want to ship consistently, without collecting endless ideas or half-started initiatives.

## Templates included
- Project
- Weekly Ship Log
- Idea Intake
- Asset Release
- Postmortem (optional)

## How to install in Obsidian
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Copy the `templates/` folder into your Obsidian vault.
3. In Obsidian, open Settings → Templates.
4. Set your templates folder to the copied `templates/` directory.

## Example weekly workflow
- Monday: Create a new Weekly Ship Log. Write the week starting date and define what will ship by Friday.
- Midweek: Update blockers and adjust scope to protect shipping.
- Friday: Record what shipped, what didn’t, and why. Decide the next week focus before you close the log.
