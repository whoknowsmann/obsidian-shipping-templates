# Ship It — Obsidian Templates for Builders Who Finish

> Stop collecting ideas. Start shipping.

## The Problem

Your Obsidian vault is full of half-baked projects, someday-maybe ideas, and plans that never became real. You're organized, but you're not *shipping*.

## The Fix

Five opinionated templates designed for one thing: **getting stuff out the door.**

No plugins required. No complex setup. Just markdown files that keep you honest and focused.

## What's Included

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Project** | Define scope, success criteria, and kill conditions upfront |
| **Weekly Ship Log** | Track what shipped (and what didn't) every week |
| **Idea Intake** | Capture ideas without committing — the parking lot |
| **Asset Release** | Pre-flight checklist for anything you publish |
| **Postmortem** | Learn from wins and failures before you forget |

## Philosophy

1. **Ship weekly.** Something. Anything. Momentum beats perfection.
2. **Kill projects.** Define kill conditions upfront. Zombies drain energy.
3. **Ideas are cheap.** Park them, don't commit. Most won't survive the week.
4. **Reflect fast.** Postmortems while context is fresh, not months later.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Copy the `templates/` folder into your Obsidian vault
3. Go to **Settings → Core Plugins → Templates** (enable if needed)
4. Set your template folder location to `templates/`
5. Use `Ctrl/Cmd + T` to insert templates

## Workflow Example

**Monday:** Create a Weekly Ship Log. Define what ships by Friday.

**During the week:** Work your Project notes. Update blockers. Adjust scope to protect the ship date.

**Friday:** Update your Ship Log. Did it ship? Why or why not? Set next week's target before you close your laptop.

**After any project:** Write a quick Postmortem. 5 minutes now saves you from repeating mistakes.
